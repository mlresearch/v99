abstract: We study adaptive regret bounds in terms of the variation of the losses
  (the so-called path-length bounds) for both multi-armed bandit and more generally
  linear bandit. We first show that the seemingly suboptimal path-length bound of
  (Wei and Luo, 2018) is in fact not improvable for adaptive adversary. Despite this
  negative result, we then develop two new algorithms, one that strictly improves
  over (Wei and Luo, 2018) with a smaller path-length measure, and the other which
  improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) for oblivious adversary when the path-length is
  large. Our algorithms are based on the well-studied optimistic mirror descent framework,
  but importantly with several novel techniques, including new optimistic predictions,
  a slight bias towards recently selected arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer
  similar to that of (Bubeck et al., 2018). Furthermore, we extend our results to
  linear bandit by showing a reduction to obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information
  problem, followed by a further reduction to convex body chasing. As a consequence
  we obtain new dynamic regret results as well as the first path-length regret bounds
  for general linear bandit.
