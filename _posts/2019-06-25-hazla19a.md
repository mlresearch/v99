abstract: " We study the Bayesian model of opinion exchange of fully rational agents
  arranged on a network. In this model, the agents receive private signals that are
  indicative of an unknown state of the world.  Then, they repeatedly announce the
  state of the world they consider most likely to their neighbors, at the same time
  updating their beliefs based on their neighbors’ announcements. This model is extensively
  studied in economics since the work of Aumann (1976) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis
  (1982). It is known that the agents eventually agree with high probability on any
  network. It is often argued that the computations needed by agents in this model
  are difficult, but prior to our results there was no rigorous work showing this
  hardness.  We show that it is  $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard for the agents to compute
  their actions in this model. Furthermore, we show that it is equally difficult even
  to approximate an agent’s posterior: It is $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to distinguish
  between the posterior being almost entirely concentrated on one state of the world
  or another.  "
